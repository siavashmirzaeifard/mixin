# mixin class

This project contains some examples about mixins with definitions.

## Definition

Mixin classes in dart allow you to have some other properties for instance. They can be constrained on particular classes. So you can create a mixin for instance that can be placed on a specific class and anybody wanting to use that mixin in future have to extend that class.
However abstract classes in Dart are the classes which can not be initialize but can actually have constructors.

For more explanations:
Please go to lib/main.dart and follow the comments.
